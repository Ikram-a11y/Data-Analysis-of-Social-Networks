Data Analysis of Social Networks is a project focused on extracting and analyzing data from various social media platforms ( Instagram , Facebook and Twitter to uncover insights about user sentiments, interactions, and trends. The project employs natural language processing techniques, such as VADER Sentiment Analysis and machine learning models like Passive Aggressive Classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to classify and understand sentiments in textual data. It includes visualizations to represent sentiment distributions and model performance, such as pie charts and confusion matrices, and advanced analysis of common keywords in positive sentiments. This project leverages tools like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to transform raw social media data into actionable insights and enhance understanding of social network dynamics.
